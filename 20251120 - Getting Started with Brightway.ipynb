    "A common approach is to store such confidential information in a file called `.env` in your project folder. Env stands for (project) environment, and the leading dot in the file name tells your operating system to treat this as a \"hidden file\". Your `.env` file will be a collection of key-value pairs, separated by an equation sign. For example, it might contain two lines such as:\n",
