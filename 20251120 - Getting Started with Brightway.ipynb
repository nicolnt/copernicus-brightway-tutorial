    "##### Get Ecoinvent account login details from a different file\n",
    "A common approach is to store such confidential information in a file called `.env` in your project folder. Env stands for (project) environment, and the leading dot in the file name tells your operating system to treat this as a \"hidden file\". Your `.env` file will be a collection of key-value pairs, separated by an equation sign. For example, it might contain two lines such as:\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "\n",
    "We can then access this information with the `dotenv` and Python's built-in `os` libraries. The cell below contains a pretty standard code snippet that you could reuse in your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you use Git (e.g GitHub) to manage your project, you will want to add `.env` in your `.gitignore` file to prevent publishing your credentials (e.g. on GitHub)."
